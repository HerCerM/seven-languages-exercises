# Problem statement:
# If youâ€™re feeling the need for a little more, write a program that picks a random number. Let a
# player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
#
# Solution:
# 1. Randomly generate an integer in the interval [1, 10].
# 2. Prompt the user for a number in the interval.
# 3. If the user-provided number is greater than the random number, print "Too high."
# 4. If the user-provided number is less than the random number, print "Too low."
# 5. If the user-provided number is equal to the random number, print "You got it right!"
# 6. Repeat 2-4 until 5 is reached, at which point the program exits.
# 7. Bonus: Just before the program exits, display the attempt count.
